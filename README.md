# Dockerapp

...

Generated with [Raygun](https://github.com/carbonfive/raygun).

# Requirements

To run the specs or fire up the server, be sure you have these:

* Ruby 2.1 (see [.ruby-version](.ruby-version))
* PostgreSQL 9.x with superuser 'postgres' with no password (```createuser -s postgres```)
* PhantomJS for JavaScript testing (```brew install phantomjs```)

# Development

### First Time Setup

After cloning, run these commands to install missing gems and prepare the database.

    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle
    $ rake db:setup db:sample_data

Note, ```rake db:sample_data``` loads a small set of data for development. Check out [db/sample_data.rb](db/sample_data.rb)
for details.

### Running the Specs

To run all ruby and javascript specs.

    $ rake

Again, with coverage for the ruby specs:

    $ rake spec:coverage

### Running the Application Locally

    $ foreman start
    $ open http://localhost:3000

### Using Guard

Guard is configured to run ruby and jasmine specs, and also listen for livereload connections. Growl is used for notifications.

    $ bundle exec guard

### Using Mailcatcher

    $ gem install mailcatcher
    $ mailcatcher
    $ open http://localhost:1080/

Learn more at [mailcatcher.me](http://mailcatcher.me/). And please don't add mailcatcher to the Gemfile.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment with CircleCI

This project is configured for continuous integration and deployment with CircleCI and Heroku. Follow
these steps for first time configuration:

1. Push the project to GitHub, if you haven't already.
1. Authenticate at [circleci.com](CircleCI) and follow this project.
1. Be sure to enable Heroku deploys from the project settings on [circleci.com](CircleCI).
1. The project should automatically be deployed on every successful build.

Check out [circle.yml](circle.yml) and [bin/deploy.sh](bin/deploy.sh) for details.

### Deploy Manually to Heroku

Install the Heroku toolbelt if you don't already have it (https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

    $ heroku apps:create dockerapp
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku run rake db:migrate db:seed

Continuous deployment from the build server is highly recommended.

### Environment Variables

Several common features and operational parameters can be set using environment variables. These are all optional.

* ```SECRET_KEY_BASE``` - Secret key base for verfying signed cookies. Should be 30+ random characters and secret!
* ```HOSTNAME``` - Canonical hostname for this application. Other incoming requests will be redirected to this hostname.
* ```BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD``` - Enable basic auth with this password.
* ```BASIC_AUTH_USER``` - Set a basic auth username (not required, password enables basic auth).
* ```PORT``` - Port to listen on (default: 3000).
